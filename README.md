#**Capstone** : Gym Application
CS 499 / Dr. Brian Thoms
Gabriel Tirado

This repository was my capstone. At the time I was heavily into working out and wanted to create something that I could use. This project gave me motivation to keep doing what I was doing and also an idea for a capstone. it allowed me to further develop my skills working on applications using Flutter.
